# VisuAlign
 
VisuAlign is one of several tools developed by by the Nesys laboratory, University of Oslo with the aim of facilitating brain atlas based analysis and integration of experimental data and knowledge about rodent brains.
VisuAlign is a stand-alone tool for user guided non-linear spatial registration (anchoring) of sectional image data, typically high resolution histological images,
to a 3D reference atlas space after a first alignment with QuickNII has been performed.
