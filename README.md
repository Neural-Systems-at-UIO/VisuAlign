# VisuAlign
 
VisuAlign is one of several tools developed by the Human Brain Project (HBP) with the aim of facilitating brain atlas based analysis and integration of experimental data and knowledge about the human and rodent brain.
VisuAlign is a stand-alone tool for user guided non-linear spatial registration (anchoring) of sectional image data, typically high resolution histological images,
to a 3D reference atlas space after a first alignment with QuickNII has been performed.
